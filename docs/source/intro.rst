What is Camper?
===============

Idea
----

Camper is an Open Source server to get your all your IoT devices together.

It provides simple interfaces to publish & view sensor data from anywhere using input channels. If you're a fan of Arduino or ESP8266 boards and love to build smarthome-ish things by yourself, you're gonna love it!

It's also possible to control your devices via Camper UI or API using output channels.

Camper is built in Django & Django REST Framework.

Communication
-------------

Camper exposes public URLs where you can post your sensor data from your microcontrollers using REST, websockets or raw TCP sockets.
